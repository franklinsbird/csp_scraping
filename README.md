# CSP Scraping Project

This project relies on a couple of API keys that must be provided via environment variables before running the scraper:

* `GOOGLE_API_KEY` – Google Maps API key used for geocoding requests.
* `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` – API key for OpenRouter used to extract structured data from pages.

Ensure these variables are set in your environment so `camp_scraper.py` can access them.
